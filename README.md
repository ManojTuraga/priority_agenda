# Priority Agenda
This ia a Web Application that allows a user to store the tasks that they have to do. Tasks are stored in a Priority Queue and each account that is created will have their own Priority Queue. Developed using Python/Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend
## Prerequisites
This code requires Python3 and the relevant Flask libraries. Just pip install -r requirements.txt and that should download the relevant Flask and Jinja2 Libraries
## Running the Code
Users can run a local version of the project by running the app.py file through the command line. By default the app uses the port 5000
```
